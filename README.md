# TalentScout: Intelligent Hiring Assistant

**TalentScout** is an intelligent recruitment assistant designed to streamline the initial candidate screening process for a fictional recruitment agency specializing in technology placements. The chatbot collects essential candidate details, generates technical questions based on the candidate’s declared tech stack, and assesses their proficiency in each area. Leveraging **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, TalentScout provides an efficient and user-friendly experience for both recruiters and candidates.

## Project Overview

TalentScout automates the early stages of candidate recruitment by:
- Gathering vital candidate information (e.g., name, contact details, years of experience).
- Asking candidates about their tech stack (programming languages, frameworks, tools).
- Generating relevant technical questions tailored to the candidate’s skill set.
- Ensuring a smooth, context-aware conversation throughout the process.
- Gracefully concluding the conversation, providing information about next steps.

By leveraging the power of **LLMs** and **Streamlit**, TalentScout allows for efficient and personalized technical assessments, offering a seamless experience for both candidates and recruiters.
